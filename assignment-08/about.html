    <p>A fact that I am very proud of, I am an Eagle Scout and was an assistant scout master for my scout troop before heading out of state for school</p>
    <p>One of the things I was good at was doing and teaching lashings, otherwise known as typing pieces of wood together</p>
    <p>So, since I know how to do this pretty well, I decided that it would be what I did this assignment.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in more ways of doing this and the other knots boy scouts learn and use, check out the site/pdf below</p>
