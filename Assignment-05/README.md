- There can be six different headings, but only one body element per file. The heading is usually a title and holds information about the page, where the body has the rest of the text and displays it on the webpage.
- Structual markup changes the general layout of a file/webpage, such as spaces and where things are located. Semantic adds details, such as underlining or emphasis on specific parts
- This was an interesting assignment. It was a little difficult to figure out some semantic markups, but the Atom software helps save a lot and effort. I also solved a few problems by looking through the textbook and google. The assignment did take me longer than I though I'd spend on it.
