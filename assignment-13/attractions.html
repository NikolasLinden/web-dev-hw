          <p>Fremont is known for many attractions, and not just its every day boutiques. Some, more weirder than others, include the Fremont Troll and a seemingly out of place statue of the Soviet Union's Vladamir Lenin. The Troll, located underneath the George Washington Memorial Bridge, is a common picture spot as it is easily accessible by both walking and driving. The concrete statue originally held an Elvis memorabilia time capsule in the volkswagen beetle it is crushing, until the car was vandailized and the capsule removed afterwards. The statue of Vladamir Lenin is located in the center of Fremont, though it's purposes are much different than one would expect. It's hands constantly painted red as a symbol, it is often dressed up for the holidays with easter bunny ears or lights and the occasional santa hat during christmas time.</p>
          <p>There are also attractions that happen every year, such as the Solstice Parade in which parade floats and naked bicylists (Yes, you are reading this correctly) come down Leary Street and through Fremont every summer solstice. The Fremony Flea Market also opens up on the area's side streets by the canal to coinside with the solstice, though it does open a smaller venue very sunday as well. More information on the Solstice Parade and other events can be found in the site below.</p>
