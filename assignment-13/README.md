1. I definitely learned a lot in this class, especially about the way a website is set up in the background. One particular thing I learned is how the repositories are set up the same as a regular file system in a computer, or rather that they are the same type of process. I also had no idea how GitHub worked before this, so it's nice to know how to use it now.
2. The main thing I learned about is the importance of the css style sheet and how everything on it works, along with how iframes can display an entire website within another website and that sites can call a specific font from another place on the internet.
3. My work cycle was fairly offbeat, since I not only had to go and collect picture and such about the community I did this project on, but also had to stop and work through what I knew, could find out, and had to listen to my dad to get. I also had to go in and edit a lot of the information afterwards since my father believed that I needed to get the facts right. I actually didn't run into any issues on this assignment, but I did take extra time to compile everything.
