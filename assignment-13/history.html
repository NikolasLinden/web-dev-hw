          <p>Being somewhat of an artistic neighborhood even for Seattle, Fremont originally was an industrial and working class residential area that had sawmills for wood working along with other businesses for small manufacturing. These businesses boomed thanks to the area being next to the Lake Washington Ship Canal as it was being built and a later built railway, bridge, and streetcar line for better transportation. However, as the city grew and the depression hit, the once widely used railway and streetcar line were closed, the neighboorhood rapidly declined with the construction of the George Washington Memorial Bridge as well. However, because of this the neighborhood recollected itself as bohemian culture settled there, and over time community projects revived the neighborhood. Today it is a self-styled and artistic suburban pocket of Seattle that has it's own flow and temperment, branding itself as the "Center of the Universe"</p>
