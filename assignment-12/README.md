1. My page is for a person looking to display information about 911 Porsches, wanting providing general information and contact information to them so they can be asked questions about it as well as see why the page is there in the about section, along with resources that are useful to potential collectors of the cards such as the Early 911s Registry forums. The site would include pictures and general information, along with services the client could possibly provide. Those are filled by the place holders.
2. A display: block allows for someone to show all information inside of a single block, and will take up all space given to it starting on a new line. An display: inline doesn't start on a new line, but will always take up as much width given to it. An inline block is much more customizable, following the rules given to it with padding and margin, allowing for blocks of different information to be put next to each other.
3. My work process on this was mostly trial and error, with me completely scrapping my original yesterday and restarting fresh today with a new idea of how I wanted to get this done.
