        <p>"Hey Third."</p>
        <p>Don't answer. Nothing to say.</p>
        <p>"Hey, Third, we're talkin to you, Third, hey bugger-lover, we're talkin to you."</p>
        <p>Can't think of anything to answer. Anything I say will make it worse. So will saying nothing.</p>
        <p>"Hey, Third, hey, turd, you flunked out, huh? Thought you were better than us, but you lost your little birdie, Thirdie, got a bandaid on your neck."</p>
        <p>"Are you going to let me through?" Ender asked.</p>
        <p>"Are we going to let him through? Should we let him through?" They all laughed. "Sure we'll let you through. First we'll let your arm through, then your butt through, then maybe a piece of your knee."</p>
        <p>The others chimed in now. "Lost your birdie, Thirdie. Lost your birdie, Thirdie."</p>
        <p>Stilson began pushing him with one hand; someone behind him then pushed him toward Stilson.</p>
        <p>"See-saw, marjorie daw," somebody said</p>
        <p>"Tennis!"</p>
        <p>"Ping-pong!"</p>
        <p>This would not have a happy ending. So Ender decided that he'd rather not be the unhappiest at the end. The next time Stilson's arm came out to push him, Ender grabbed at it. He missed.</p>
        <p>"Oh, gonna fight me, huh? Gonna fight me, Thirdie?"</p>
        <p>The people behind Ender grabbed at him, to hold him.</p>
        <p>Ender did not feel like laughing, but he laughed. "You mean it takes this many of you to fight one Third?"</p>
        <p>"We're people, not Thirds, turd face. You're about as strong as a fart!"
But they let go of him. And as soon as they did, Ender kicked out high and hard, catching Stilson square in the breastbone. He dropped. It took Ender by surprise--he hadn't thought to put Stilson on the ground with one kick. It didn't occur to him that Stilson didn't take a fight like this seriously, that he wasn't prepared for a truly desperate blow.
</p>
        <p>For a moment, the others backed away and Stilson lay motionless. They were all wondering if he was dead. Ender, however, was trying to figure out a way to forestall vengeance. To keep them from taking him in a pack tomorrow. I have to win this now, and for all time, or I'll fight it every day and it will get worse and worse</p>
        <p>Ender knew the unspoken rules of manly warfare, even though he was only six. It was forbidden to strike the opponent who lay helpless on the ground; only an animal would do that.</p>
        <p>So Ender walked to Stilson's supine body and kicked him again, viciously, in the ribs. Stilson groaned and rolled away from him. Ender walked around him and kicked him again, in the crotch. Stilson could not make a sound; he only doubled up and tears streamed out of his eyes.</p>
        <p>Then Ender looked at the others coldly. "You might be having some idea of ganging up on me. You could probably beat me up pretty bad. But just remember what I do to people who try to hurt me. From then on you'd be wondering when I'd get you, and how bad it would be." He kicked Stilson in the face. Blood from his nose spattered the ground nearby. "It wouldn't be this bad," Ender said. "It would be worse."</p>
        <p>He turned and walked away. Nobody followed him. He turned a corner into the corridor leading to the bus stop. He could hear the boys behind him saying, "Geez. Look at him. He's wasted." Ender leaned his head against the wall of the corridor and cried until the bus came. I am just like Peter. Take my monitor away, and I am just like Peter.</p>
