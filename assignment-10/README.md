1. System Fonts are the built in fonts that computers typically use. Web Fonts are fonts that are loaded through a link from a page. Web-Safe Fonts are fonts that can typically be loaded by any computer as a fall back should an intended font fail to loaded.
2. In case a font cannot load, it'll default to one that a computer can almost always use so the text can still be displayed and read by the user.
3. My work cycle for this was about an hour straight of work until I needed a question answered, and then I had to wait to upload since moodle was apparently down and my README didn't save originally.
