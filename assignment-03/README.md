I decided to take this class because I have some understanding about web design, but I want to learn more. It's important to a good understanding about how systems like the web works if you're going to be working with people who's job requires it in the future. If I can't understand what they're doing, then I won't be able to relate it to my own job very well.



- I hope to learn more about coding in this class to solidify my knowledge about it
- I hope to learn the overlying process of creating a website
- I hope to learn how to properly design the look of a website, so whatever I websites I might add to or make doesn't look like an absolute mess
